  <h1>E-Commerce Shipping Prediction</h1>
</div>

## Project Overview
The e-commerce industry thrives on the promise of timely deliveries. However, the unpredictability of shipment arrival times can undermine customer satisfaction and trust. This project seeks to develop a robust predictive model to forecast whether an e-commerce shipment will be delivered on time. By leveraging historical shipment data and advanced machine learning techniques, we aim to provide reliable delivery estimates and optimize logistics operations.
